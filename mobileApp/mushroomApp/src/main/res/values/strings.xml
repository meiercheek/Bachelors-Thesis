    <string name="amanita_muscaria_name">Fly amanita</string>
    <string name="amanita_muscaria_desc">Latin: Amanita muscaria.\n\nArguably the most iconic toadstool species, the fly agaric is a large white-gilled, white-spotted, usually red mushroom, and is one of the most recognizable and widely encountered in popular culture.\n\nAlthough poisonous, death due to poisoning from A. muscaria ingestion is quite rare.\n\nParboiling twice with water draining weakens its toxicity and breaks down the mushroom\'s psychoactive substances; it is eaten in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America.\n\nIt has a religious significance in Sami, Siberian, Eurasian and other cultures.\n\nFly agaric fruiting bodies emerge from the soil looking like white eggs.\n\nAfter emerging from the ground, the cap is covered with numerous small white to yellow pyramid-shaped warts.\n\nThese are remnants of the universal veil, a membrane that encloses the entire mushroom when it is still very young.\n\nA. muscaria is illegal to buy, sell, or possess in the Netherlands since December 2008. Possession of amounts larger than 0.5 g dried or 5 g fresh lead to a criminal charge.</string>

    <string name="amanita_pantherina_name">Panther cap</string>
    <string name="amanita_pantherina_desc">Latin: Amanita pantherina\n\nThe panther cap is an uncommon mushroom, found in both deciduous, especially beech and, less frequently, coniferous woodland and rarely meadows throughout Europe, western Asia in late summer and autumn.\n\nThe cap reaches a diameter of 6-10 cm. It is hemispherical, then glazed, flat when aged - with a smooth surface, ocher to dark brown, covered with white spots. The edge is usually ridged. The gills are white, dense, free at the stipe. The white rather slender mandrel carries a narrow smooth ring. The white flesh shows an inconspicuous pleasant aroma and delicate taste. Spore dust is white.\n\nA. pantherina is illegal to buy, sell, or possess in the Netherlands since December 2008. Possession of amounts larger than 0.5 g dried or 5 g fresh lead to a criminal charge.\n</string>

    <string name="amanita_phalloides_name">Death cap</string>
    <string name="amanita_phalloides_desc">Latin: Amanita phalloides\n\nThe large fruiting bodies (mushrooms) appear in summer and autumn; the caps are generally greenish in color with a white stipe and gills. The cap color is variable, including white forms, and is thus not a reliable identifier.\n\n\nThese toxic mushrooms resemble several edible species (most notably Caesar\'s mushroom and the straw mushroom) commonly consumed by humans, increasing the risk of accidental poisoning. Amatoxins, the class of toxins found in these mushrooms, are thermostable: they resist changes due to heat, so their toxic effects are not reduced by cooking.\n\n\nAmanita phalloides is one of the most poisonous of all known mushrooms. It is estimated that as little as half a mushroom contains enough toxin to kill an adult human.\n\n\nIt has been involved in the majority of human deaths from mushroom poisoning,[2] possibly including the deaths of Roman Emperor Claudius in AD 54 and Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI in 1740.\n\n\nIt has been the subject of much research and many of its biologically active agents have been isolated. The principal toxic constituent is α-amanitin, which damages the liver and kidneys, causing liver and kidney failure that can be fatal.\n</string>


    <string name="boletus_reticulatus_edulis_name">Summer cep</string>
    <string name="boletus_reticulatus_edulis_desc">Latin: Boletus reticulatus\n\nIt occurs in deciduous forests of Europe where it forms a symbiotic mycorrhizal relationship with species of oak. The fungus produces fruiting bodies in the summer months which are edible and popularly collected.\n\n\nThe summer cep\'s fruiting body is a mushroom with a swollen bulbous stem, and large convex cap. The cap is round and usually up to 20 centimeters in diameter. It bears a velvety brown, rust to chocolate cuticle which when dry often cracks to reveal the white flesh underneath, giving the appearance of a net.\n\n\nThe flesh is white and thick and remains firm if yellowish as the mushroom ages and is often attacked by insect larvae. Its odor is pleasant.\n\n\nChitin, hemicellulose, and pectin-like carbohydrates—all indigestible by humans—contribute to high proportion of insoluble fiber in B. reticulatus. It also contains more tocopherol than other species of mushroom.\n</string>

    <string name="calocera_viscosa_name">Yellow stagshorn</string>
    <string name="calocera_viscosa_desc">Latin: Calocera viscosa\n\n\nIt has bright orange, yellow or occasionally white branching basidiocarps, which are somewhat gelatinous in texture and slimy to the touch (hence the specific name). It is relatively large for a jelly fungus and can reach up to ten centimeters in height.\n\n\nIt is widespread and common, and its bright color makes it stand out in its habitat. It grows on decaying conifer wood, typically stumps, and roots, although this may not be obvious if the wood is covered in leaf litter. It fruits throughout the year but is most seen in autumn. \n\n\nIt is not poisonous, but its tough gelatinous texture and nondescript taste and odor make it unattractive as a food. However, its striking color has led to it being used as a garnish on occasion.\n</string>

    <string name="cantharellus_cibarius_name">Chanterelle</string>
    <string name="cantharellus_cibarius_desc">Latin: Cantharellus cibarius\n\nIt grows in Europe from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean Basin, mainly in deciduous and coniferous forests. Due to its characteristic color and shape, it is easy to distinguish from mushrooms with potential toxicity that discourage human consumption. \n\n\nA commonly eaten and favored mushroom, the chanterelle is typically harvested from late summer to late fall in its European distribution.\n\n\nChanterelles are used in many culinary dishes and can be preserved by either drying or freezing. An oven should not be used when drying it because can result in the mushroom becoming bitter.\n\n\nThe mushroom is easy to detect and recognize in nature. The body is 3–10 centimeters wide and 5–10 cm tall. The color varies from yellow to dark yellow. Red spots will appear on the cap of the mushroom if it is damaged. Chanterelle mushrooms have a faint aroma and flavor of apricots.\n</string>

    <string name="chlorociboria_aeruginascens_name">Green elfcup</string>
    <string name="chlorociboria_aeruginascens_desc">Latin: Chlorociboria aeruginascens\n\nA saprobic species of mushroom, also commonly known as the green wood cup because of its characteristic small, green, saucer-shaped fruit bodies. Although the actual fruit bodies are infrequently seen, the green staining of wood caused by the fungus is more prevalent.\n\nIt grows on debarked deciduous wood, mostly oak or hazel, especially on the underside. The wood colonized with the species is of greenish tint with mycelium. It is abundant in the northern temperate zone throughout the year.\n</string>

    <string name="cortinarius_semisanguineus_name">Surprise webcap</string>
    <string name="cortinarius_semisanguineus_desc">Latin: Cortinarius semisanguineus\n\nIt is a medium-sized mushroom with a pale brown to ochre cap, and bright blood-red gills. It belongs to the genus Cortinarius, a group collectively known as webcaps. It is found growing in conifer plantations, and has recently been given the fanciful common name of surprise webcap. In the past it has been called the red-gilled webcap.\n\n\nThe cap is bell-shaped, and later flattens. It is usually between 2–8 cm across, brownish ochre, or umber and with a darker centre. It is covered in fine fibrils, and is dry. The stipe is usually the same colour as the cap or paler, and is smooth, or finely fibrillose like the cap.\n\n\nIt is long, slim, and cylindrical. Cortinal remnants often left on the stem in this species can be quite fleeting. The gills are adnate, markedly sinuate, and fairly crowded. They are initially blood-red, but turn cinnamon-brown on aging, giving a spore print of the same colour. The flesh is said to smell of radishes, and it is ochre in the stem, but more olive in the cap.\n\n\nCortinarius semisanguineus appears in conifer, or mixed conifer, and birch woods in autumn (fall). It is occasional in Britain, Europe, Scandinavia, and parts of North America. It has a mycorrhizal relationship with birch trees (Betula), and other coniferous softwood trees. It is often abundant under young spruce in plantations on acid soil, appearing from August to November.\n\n\nIt cannot be recommended for the table as it is suspected of being toxic.\nCortinarius semisanguineus can be used as a dye for textile yarns.\n</string>

    <string name="cortinarius_violaceus_name">Violet webcap</string>
    <string name="cortinarius_violaceus_desc">Latin: Cortinarius violaceus\n\nCortinarius violaceus, commonly known as the violet webcap or violet cort, is a fungus in the webcap genus Cortinarius native across the Northern Hemisphere. The fruit bodies are dark purple mushrooms with caps up to 15 cm across, sporting gills underneath. The stalk measures 6 to 12 centimetres sometimes with a thicker base. The dark flesh has a smell reminiscent of cedar wood. Forming symbiotic (ectomycorrhizal) relationships with the roots of various plant species, C. violaceus is found predominantly in conifer forests in North America and deciduous forests in Europe.\nCortinarius violaceus has a convex cap of 3.5–15 centimetres in diameter with an incurved margin. It is dark violet to blue-black in colour, and is covered in fine, downy scales. The cap surface, unlike that of many other Cortinarius species, is neither sticky nor slimy, though it is occasionally greasy. The stipe, or stalk, is 6 to 18 cm tall. Due to its swollen, bulbous nature, the base of the stipe can sometimes be as wide as 4 cm. The stipe is a similar color to the cap, and covered in wool-like fibrils; purple mycelium can be present at the base.Younger specimens feature a veil, but this vanishes quickly. The flesh is violet, but darker below the pileipellis and in the stipe. The flesh has a mild taste, indistinctly reminiscent of cedar wood, with a slight, pleasant smell, also reminiscent of cedar wood. The gills are dark violet, changing to a purplish-brown with age. \nIt is found across North America, Europe, and Asia. Although widespread, it is not common anywhere in Europe, and it is listed as endangered in the British Isles. Cortinarius violaceus is a rare component of subarctic areas of western Greenland. It has not been recorded from Iceland.\nIn Europe, it grows in deciduous woodland during autumn, especially among oak, birch and beech, but is also found on occasion with conifers.\nThe species favours acidic soil. Cortinarius violaceus forms mycorrhizal associations with several species of tree.\nIn this symbiotic relationship, the fungus gains carbon from the plant and supplies it with beneficial minerals.In Nordic countries, its hosts include white birch , silver birch, European aspen and rarely European beech.\nThey are sometimes considered inedible, and sometimes considered edible, but not choice. Instead, the primary appeal of the species to mushroom hunters, is its beauty. Its similarity to some other (inedible or toxic) webcaps renders it risky to eat. The taste after cooking is reportedly bitter.\nThe color of C. violaceus cannot be converted to a dye, unlike that of some other Cortinarius species, such as C. semisanguineus. The color is caused by an elusive pigment that has been difficult to isolate.\n</string>

    <string name="galerina_marginata_name">Funeral bell</string>
    <string name="galerina_marginata_desc">Latin: Galerina marginata\n\nIt is known colloquially as funeral bell, deadly skullcap, autumn skullcap or deadly galerina, is a species of extremely poisonous mushroom-forming fungus in the family Hymenogastraceae of the order Agaricales. It contains the same deadly amatoxins found in the death cap (Amanita phalloides). Ingestion in toxic amounts causes severe liver damage with vomiting, diarrhea, hypothermia, and eventual death if not treated rapidly. About ten poisonings have been attributed to the species now grouped as G. marginata over the last century.\n\n\nG. marginata is widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, North America, and Asia, and has also been found in Australia. It is a wood-rotting fungus that grows predominantly on decaying conifer wood. The fruit bodies of the mushroom have brown to yellow-brown caps that fade in color when drying. The gills are brownish and give a rusty spore print. A well-defined membranous ring is typically seen on the stems of young specimens but often disappears with age. In older fruit bodies, the caps are flatter and the gills and stems browner. The species is a classic \"little brown mushroom\" – a catchall category that includes all small to medium-sized, hard-to-identify brownish mushrooms, and may be easily confused with several edible species.\n\n\nGalerina marginata is a saprobic fungus, obtaining nutrients by breaking down organic matter. It is known to have most of the major classes of secreted enzymes that dissolve plant cell wall polysaccharides and has been used as a model saprobe in recent studies of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Because of its variety of enzymes capable of breaking down wood and other lignocellulosic materials, the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) is currently sequencing its genome. The fungus is typically reported to grow on or near the wood of conifers, although it has been observed to grow on hardwoods as well. Fruit bodies may grow solitarily, but more typically in groups or small clusters, and appear in the summer to autumn. Sometimes, they may grow on buried wood and thus appear to be growing on soil.\n\n\nThe toxins found in Galerina marginata are known as amatoxins. Amatoxins belong to a family of bicyclic octapeptide derivatives composed of an amino acid ring bridged by a sulfur atom and characterized by differences in their side groups; these compounds are responsible for more than 90% of fatal mushroom poisonings in humans.\n</string>

    <string name="gyromitra_esculenta_name">False Morel</string>
    <string name="gyromitra_esculenta_desc">Latin: Gyromitra esculenta\nIt is an ascomycete fungus from the genus Gyromitra, widely distributed across Europe and North America. It normally fruits in sandy soils under coniferous trees in spring and early summer. The fruiting body, or mushroom, is an irregular brain-shaped cap dark brown in colour that can reach 10 centimetres (4 inches) high and 15 cm (6 in) wide, perched on a stout white stipe up to 6 cm (2+1⁄2 in) high.\n\n\nAlthough potentially fatal if eaten raw, Gyromitra esculenta is a popular delicacy in Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, and the upper Great Lakes region of North America. Although popular in some districts of the eastern Pyrenees, it is prohibited from sale to the public in Spain. It may be sold fresh in Finland, but it must be accompanied by warnings and instructions on correct preparation.\n\n\nAlthough it is still commonly parboiled before preparation, evidence suggests that even this procedure may not make Gyromitra esculenta entirely safe for consumption.[3] When consumed, the principal active agent, gyromitrin, is hydrolyzed into the toxic compound monomethylhydrazine (MMH). The toxin affects the liver, central nervous system, and sometimes the kidneys. Symptoms of poisoning involve vomiting and diarrhea several hours after consumption, followed by dizziness, lethargy and headache. Severe cases may lead to delirium, coma and death after five to seven days.\n</string>

    <string name="hygrocybe_cantharellus_name">Goblet Waxcap</string>
    <string name="hygrocybe_cantharellus_desc">Latin: Hygrocybe Cantharellus\n\n\nIt has a diameter of 1-3 cm, convex in young specimens, flat in older specimens, or concave in the center, even funnel-shaped. The edge remains curled for a long time, often notched in older specimens. Surface dry, naked, or fine-grained (especially in the center). The color ranges from yellow orange to scarlet.\n\n\nIt is widespread in North America, Central America, Europe, and New Zealand. It is also reported to occur in Korea, Japan and the Canary Islands. It is also on the lists of endangered species in Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany and the Netherlands.\n\n\nIt grows on the ground in grasses. It produces fruiting bodies from August to November.\n</string>

    <string name="lactarius_deliciosus_name">Saffron milk cap</string>
    <string name="lactarius_deliciosus_desc">Latin: Lactarius deliciosus\n\n\nIt is commonly known as the saffron milk cap and red pine mushroom, is one of the best-known members of the large milk-cap genus Lactarius in the order Russulales. It is found in Europe and has been accidentally introduced to other countries under conifers and can be found growing in pine plantations. A fresco in the Roman town of Herculaneum appears to depict Lactarius deliciosus and is one of the earliest pieces of art to illustrate a fungus.\n\n\nLactarius deliciosus has a carrot orange cap that is convex to vase shaped, inrolled when young, 4 to 14 centimetres across, often with darker orange lines in the form of concentric circles. The cap is sticky and viscid when wet but is often dry. It has crowded decurrent gills and a squat orange stipe that is often hollow, 3 to 8 cm long and 1 to 2 cm thick. This mushroom stains a deep green color when handled. When fresh, the mushroom exudes an orange-red latex or \"milk\" that does not change color.\n\n\nLactarius deliciosus is an edible mushroom, but despite its name, may taste mild or bitter. It is widely collected in the Iberian Peninsula and used in Spanish cuisine—being probably the most sought after wild mushroom in the country.\n</string>

    <string name="leccinum_scabrum_name">Brown Birch Bolete</string>
    <string name="leccinum_scabrum_desc">Latin: Leccinum scabrum\n\n\nIt is commonly known as the rough-stemmed bolete, scaber stalk, and birch bolete, is an edible mushroom in the family Boletaceae, and was formerly classified as Boletus scaber. The birch bolete is widespread in Europe, in the Himalayas in Asia, and elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere, occurring only in mycorrhizal association with birch trees. It fruits from June to October. This mushroom is also becoming increasingly common in Australia and New Zealand where it is likely introduced.\n\n\nThe cap is 5–15 cm wide. At first, it is hemispherical, and later becomes flatter. The skin of the cap is tan or brownish, usually with a lighter edge;[3] it is smooth, bald, and dry to viscid.\n\n\nLeccinum scabrum is a European species that has been introduced to various areas of the world, mostly appearing in urban areas. In New Zealand, it associates solely with Betula pendula(birch tree).\n</string>

    <string name="lepista_nuda_name">Wood blewit</string>
    <string name="lepista_nuda_desc">Latin: Lepista nuda\n\n\nIt is an edible mushroom native to Europe and North America. It is found in both coniferous and deciduous woodlands. It is a fairly distinctive mushroom that is widely eaten, though there is some caution about edibility. Nevertheless, it has been cultivated in Britain, the Netherlands and France.\n\n\nIt is a saprotrophic species, growing on decaying leaf litter. In the United Kingdom, it appears from September through to December.\n\n\nThis mushroom can range from lilac to purple pink. Some North American specimens are duller and tend toward tan, but usually have purplish tones on the stem and gills. Younger specimens are lighter with more convex caps, while mature specimens have a darker color and flatter cap, ranging from 4–15 cm in diameter. The gills are attached to the short, stout stem, which is about 2–6 cm long and 1–2.5 cm wide, sometimes larger at the base.\n\n\nWood blewits are generally regarded as a good edible, but they are known to cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. This is particularly likely if the mushroom is consumed raw, though allergic reactions are known even from cooked blewits. It is therefore important to cook wood blewits before eating, as consumption of raw specimens could lead to indigestion. Wood blewits contain the sugar trehalose, which is edible for most people.\n</string>

    <string name="macrolepiota_procera_name">Parasol mushroom</string>
    <string name="macrolepiota_procera_desc">Latin: Macrolepiota procera\n\n\nThe parasol mushroom is a basidiomycete fungus with a large, prominent fruiting body resembling a parasol. It is a common species on well-drained soils. It is found solitary or in groups and fairy rings in pastures and occasionally in woodland. Globally, it is widespread in temperate regions.\n\n\nThe height and cap diameter of a mature specimen may both reach 30 - 40 cm. The stipe is relatively thin and reaches full height before the cap has expanded. The stipe is very fibrous in texture which renders it inedible. \n\n\nThe immature cap is compact and egg-shaped, with the cap margin around the stipe, sealing a chamber inside the cap. As it matures, the margin breaks off, leaving a fleshy, movable ring around the stipe. At full maturity, the cap is flat, with a chocolate-brown umbo in the centre that is leathery to touch. Dark and cap-coloured flakes remain on the upper surface of the cap and can be removed easily. The gills are crowded, free, and white with a pale pink tinge sometimes present. The spore print is white. It has a pleasant nutty smell. When sliced, the white flesh may turn a pale pink.\n\n\nMacrolepiota procera is a choice edible mushroom. It is very sought-after and popular in Europe, due in part to its large size, seasonal frequency, and versatility in the kitchen. In the UK, it may be found from July through to November.\n\n\nThe parasol mushroom is difficult to mistake for any other, especially in regions like Europe where the poisonous look-alike Chlorophyllum molybdites is rare. The spores and lamellae of C. molybdites are notably greener in appearance. Nevertheless, as with picking any fungus for consumption, caution should be exercised at all times.\n\nMacrolepiota procera is also edible raw, though its close lookalikes in the genus Chlorophyllum are toxic raw.\n</string>

    <string name="pleurotus_ostreatus_name">Oyster mushroom</string>
    <string name="pleurotus_ostreatus_desc">Latin: Pleurotus ostreatus\n\n\nThe oyster mushroom, oyster fungus, or hiratake, is a common edible mushroom. It was first cultivated in Germany as a subsistence measure during World War I and is now grown commercially around the world for food. It is related to the similarly cultivated king oyster mushroom. Oyster mushrooms can also be used industrially for mycoremediation purposes.\n\n\nThe oyster mushroom is widespread in many temperate and subtropical forests throughout the world, although it is absent from the Pacific Northwest of North America, being replaced by P. pulmonarius and P. populinus. It is a saprotroph that acts as a primary decomposer of wood, especially deciduous trees, and beech trees in particular. It is a white-rot wood-decay fungus.\n\n\nThe oyster mushroom is one of the few known carnivorous mushrooms. Its mycelia can kill and digest nematodes, which is believed to be a way in which the mushroom obtains nitrogen.\n\n\nThe oyster mushroom is a choice edible, and is a delicacy in Japanese, Korean and Chinese cuisine. It is frequently served on its own, in soups, stuffed, or in stir-fry recipes with soy sauce. Oyster mushrooms may be used in sauces, such as oyster sauce. The mushroom\'s taste has been described as mild with a slight odor similar to anise. Oyster mushrooms are used in the Czech and Slovak contemporary cuisine in soups and stews in a similar fashion to meat. The oyster mushroom is best when picked young; as the mushroom ages, the flesh becomes tough and the flavor becomes acrid and unpleasant.\n</string>

    <string name="rubroboletus_satanas_name">Devil\'s Bolete</string>
    <string name="rubroboletus_satanas_desc">Latin: Rubroboletus satanas\n\n\nFound in broad-leaved and mixed woodland in the warmer regions of Europe, it is classified as a poisonous mushroom, known to cause gastrointestinal symptoms of diarrhea and violent vomiting. However, reports of poisoning are rare, due to its striking appearance and at times putrid smell, which discourage casual experimentation.\n\n\nThe squat, brightly coloured fruiting bodies are often massive and imposing, with a pale, dull-coloured velvety cap up to 30 cm, yellow to orange-red pores and a bulbous red-patterned stem. The flesh turns blue when cut or bruised, and overripe fruit bodies often emit an unpleasant smell reminiscent of carrion. It is arguably the largest bolete found in Europe.\n\n\nThe Satan\'s bolete was described by German mycologist Harald Othmar Lenz in 1831. Lenz was aware of several reports of adverse reactions from people who had consumed this fungus and apparently felt himself ill from its \"emanations\" while describing it, hence giving it its sinister epithet.\n</string>

    <string name="russula_cyanoxantha_name">Charcoal burner</string>
    <string name="russula_cyanoxantha_desc">Latin: Russula cyanoxantha\n\n\nIt is an edible mushroom. It was designated \"Mushroom of the Year\" in 1997 by the German Association of Mycology.\n\n\nThe most salient characteristic is the weak gills, which feel greasy to the touch, are flexible and do not break. The cap is 4–18 cm wide, convex at first and later flattened, and greenish to bright brown; they vary considerably in color. The stipe is pure white, slightly convex underneath, from 6–12 cm in height and 1.5–5 cm in diameter. The spores are pure white.\n\n\nIt is suitable for many kinds of preparation; the flesh is not as hard as that of many other edible Russulas. It has a mild, nutty taste.\n</string>

    <string name="russula_lepida_name">Rosy russula</string>
    <string name="russula_lepida_desc">Latin: Russula lepida\n\n\n(synonym Russula rosea), known as the rosy russula, is a north temperate, commonly found mushroom of the large \"brittlegill\" genus Russula.\n\nThe cap is convex when young, later flat, mostly bright cinnabar to carmine red; often with yellow spots and up to 10 cm in diameter. The gills are pale straw-yellow, brittle, and occasionally with a red edge at the rim of the cap. The spores are pale-cream. The stem is usually flushed carmine, but can be pure white. The flesh is hard and bitter-tasting; some consider it edible, others inedible.\n\n\nAbundant in almost all of Europe, individually or in groups, in all forests.  A typical ectomycorrhizal fungus. As a rule, we find it near coniferous and deciduous trees, mostly under beeches, often in bright places. It also occurs in dry weather, from summer to autumn. \n\n\nIt is mentioned in some publications as edible, not very tasty, in small quantities suitable for mixtures. Due to its difficult distinction from other bitter species, its use is not recommended.\n</string>

    <string name="sarcoscypha_austriaca_name">Scarlet elfcup</string>
    <string name="sarcoscypha_austriaca_desc">Latin: Sarcoscypha austriaca\n\n\nThis species is found growing on fallen pieces of dead hardwood among mosses and leaf litter in damp habitats in winter and early spring. The fruiting body is cup-shaped with a scarlet smooth, shiny interior. The exterior is covered with a felted mass of short hairs in varying shades of white and pink and a stubby stem. The flesh is white and rubbery with a thin red layer lining the cup. The spore print is white and the spores are ellipsoidal with flattened ends and containing several oil droplets. On the outside of the cup the hairs are curly or corkscrew shaped.</string>

    <string name="suillus_luteus_name">Slippery Jack</string>
    <string name="suillus_luteus_desc">Latin: Suillus luteus\n\n\nThe cap is chestnut, rusty, olive brown, or dark brown in color and generally 4–10 cm in diameter at maturity. The cap has a distinctive conical shape, later flattening out. It is slimy to the touch, bare, smooth, and glossy even when dry, and the cuticle is easily peeled off. The tiny, circular pores of the tubes are initially yellow but turn olive to dark yellow with maturity. Like the skin of the cap, they can be readily peeled away from the flesh.\n\n\nSuillus luteus is a pioneer species that typically establishes itself in the early stages of forest succession. The fungus forms mycorrhizal associations with various species of pine.\n\n\nSuillus luteus is an edible mushroom, but the slime must be removed. Although some authors regard it as one of low quality and generally inferior to co-occurring species such as Boletus pinophilus the species is considered a delicacy in Slavic cultures.\n</string>

Fruit bodies are brown, gelatinous, and have a noticeably ear-like shape. They grow on wood, especially elder. The specific epithet is derived from the belief that Judas Iscariot hanged himself from an elder tree.\n\n\nThe fungus can be found throughout the year in Europe, where it normally grows on wood of broadleaf trees and shrubs. It was formerly thought to be a variable species with a worldwide distribution, but molecular research, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, has shown that non-European species are distinct.\n\n\nAuricularia auricula-judae was used in folk medicine as recently as the 19th century for complaints including sore throats, sore eyes and jaundice, and as an astringent.
